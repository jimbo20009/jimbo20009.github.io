				<h1>Our Fabulous Venue</h1>
				<h2>Spring-loaded wood floors!</h2>

				<p>Our venue since 2010, the historic <a href="http//www.yorktowne.com">Yorktowne Hotel</a> features the elegance of a grand hotel paired with modern conveniences, such as free wireless high-speed Internet access. The 11-story, Renaissance Revival-style hotel reflects the vivacious spirit of the 1920s with 20-foot-high ceilings, ornate brass and crystal chandeliers, wood-paneled rooms, and wall-sized mirrors.</p>

				<img class="pic" src="images/floor_pic.jpg" alt="Square dancers on wood floor" title="Dancing away the hours" align="right">

				<p>Most importantly, two of the hotel’s grand ballrooms feature traditional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprung_floor">spring-loaded hardwood dance floors</a>. Such floors provide subtle “give” via underlying layers of woven wooden battens that bend. As discerning dancers know, sprung floors feel softer, enhance performance, cause less fatigue, absorb shocks, and reduce injuries. They are considered the best type of floor for dancing and other indoor sports. Such floors are rare and difficult to find—especially originals laid nearly a century ago.</p>

				<p id="quote">“Dance and stomp as hard as you want... your muscles may get sore but your joints won’t. It’s very forgiving. You must experience this floor if you love to dance.”</p>
	
				<img class="pic" src="images/hotel.jpg" alt="Old image of Yorktowne Hotel" title="A Grande Dame of a hotel" align="right">
	
				<p>The hotel is located in the heart of <a href="http//www.yorkpa.org">Downtown York</a>, within easy walking distance of the historic Central Market and dozens of trendy restaurants and brewpubs. Briefly the capital of the young United States, York is close to Gettysburg, Lancaster, and many historic sites and charming towns.</p>

				<p>To reserve a double-occupancy room at the special group rate of $89/night, call 800-233-9324 before October 11, 2016 and identify yourself as a dancer with DC Lambda Squares.</p>

				<p>With advance notice, pets up to 50 pounds can stay for a small fee.</p>
