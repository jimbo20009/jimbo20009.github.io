				<h1>Our Fabulous Venue</h1>
				<h2>Spring-loaded wood floors!</h2>

				<figure id="hotel">
					<img class="pic" src="images/hotel.jpg" alt="Old image of Yorktowne Hotel" title="The Grande Dame of York">
					<figcaption>The Dowager Countess of Grantham would have been delighted to stay here.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>Our venue since 2010, the <a href="http//www.yorktowne.com/">Yorktowne</a> is an elegant grand dame of a hotel. Listed on the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/nr/">National Register of Historic Places</a>, the 11-story, Renaissance Revival-style building reflects the vivacious spirit of the 1920s with 20-foot-high ceilings, ornate brass, crystal chandeliers, wood-paneled rooms, and wall-sized mirrors. Modern conveniences include complementary wireless high-speed Internet, a fitness center, and a business center.</p>

				<p>Most importantly&mdash;and why we keep going back&mdash;two of the hotel’s grand ballrooms feature traditional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprung_floor/">spring-loaded hardwood dance floors</a>. Such floors provide subtle “give” via underlying layers of woven wooden battens that bend.</p> 
				
				<img id="floor" class="pic" src="images/floor_pic.jpg" alt="Square dancers on wood floor" title="Dancing away the hours">

				<p>As discerning dancers know, sprung floors are considered the best type of floor for dancing and other indoor sports. They feel softer, enhance performance, cause less fatigue, absorb shocks, and reduce injuries. Such floors are rare and difficult to find&mdash;especially originals laid nearly a century ago.</p>

				<div id="quote">
					<p>"Dance and stomp as hard as you want... your muscles may get sore but your joints won’t. It’s very forgiving. You must experience this floor if you love to dance.”</p>
				</div>

				<p>The hotel is located in the heart of historic downtown <a href="http//www.yorkpa.org/">York</a>, within easy walking distance of the Romanesque <a href="http://www.centralmarketyork.com/">Central Market</a> and dozens of trendy restaurants and brewpubs. Briefly the capital of the young United States, York is close to <a href="http://www.destinationgettysburg.com/">Gettysburg</a>, the <a href="http://www.discoverlancaster.com/">Pennsylvania Dutch Country</a>, and many other historic sites, charming towns, and antique shops. Get an early start on your holiday shopping!</p>

				<p>To reserve a double-occupancy room at the special group rate of <span class="bold_red">$89/night</span>, call <span class="bold_purple">(800)&nbsp;233&#8209;9324</span> before <span class="bold_purple">October&nbsp;11,&nbsp;2016</span> and identify yourself as a dancer with DC&nbsp;Lambda&nbsp;Squares.
