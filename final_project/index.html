			<h1>Our Fabulous Venue</h1>
			<h2>Spring-loaded wood floors!</h2>

			<img id="hotel" class="pic" src="images/hotel.jpg" alt="Old image of Yorktowne Hotel" title="The Grande Dame of York">

			<p>Our venue since 2010, the historic <a href="http//www.yorktowne.com">Yorktowne Hotel</a> is an elegant grand-dame of a hotel. The 11-story, Renaissance Revival-style building reflects the vivacious spirit of the 1920s with 20-foot-high ceilings, ornate brass, crystal chandeliers, wood-paneled rooms, and wall-sized mirrors. Modern conveniences include complementary wireless high-speed Internet, a fitness center, and a business center.</p>

			<p>Most importantly, two of the hotel’s grand ballrooms feature traditional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprung_floor">spring-loaded hardwood dance floors</a>. Such floors provide subtle “give” via underlying layers of woven wooden battens that bend. As discerning dancers know, sprung floors feel softer, enhance performance, cause less fatigue, absorb shocks, and reduce injuries. They are considered the best type of floor for dancing and other indoor sports. Such floors are rare and difficult to find—especially originals laid nearly a century ago.</p>

			<img id="floor" class="pic" src="images/floor_pic.jpg" alt="Square dancers on wood floor" title="Dancing away the hours">

			<p id="quote">"Dance and stomp as hard as you want... your muscles may get sore but your joints won’t. It’s very forgiving. You must experience this floor if you love to dance.”</p>

			<p>The hotel is located in the heart of historic <a href="http//www.yorkpa.org">Downtown York</a>, within easy walking distance of the Romanesque <a href="http://www.centralmarketyork.com">Central Market</a> and dozens of trendy restaurants and brewpubs. Briefly the capital of the young United States, York is close to <a href="http://www.destinationgettysburg.com">Gettysburg</a>, the <a href="http://www.discoverlancaster.com">Pennsylvania Dutch Country</a>, and many other historic sites and charming towns.</p>

 			<img id="bell" class="pic" src="images/bell.jpg" alt="Antique brass bell" title="Old-style brass ornamentation">

			<p>To reserve a double-occupancy room at the special group rate of <span class="bold_red">$89/night</span>, call <span class="bold_purple">(800)&nbsp;233&#8209;9324</span> before <span class="bold_purple">October&nbsp;11,&nbsp;2016</span> and identify yourself as a dancer with DC Lambda Squares. Pets up to 50 pounds can stay with advance notice and a small fee.</p>
