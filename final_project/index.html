			<h1>Our Fabulous Venue</h1>
			<h2>Spring-loaded wood floors!</h2>

			<img class="pic" src="images/hotel.jpg" alt="Old image of Yorktowne Hotel" title="A Grande Dame of a hotel" width="285px" height="380" align="right">

			<p>Our venue since 2010, the historic <a href="http//www.yorktowne.com">Yorktowne Hotel</a> is an elegant grand-dame of a hotel. The 11-story, Renaissance Revival-style building reflects the vivacious spirit of the 1920s with 20-foot-high ceilings, ornate brass, crystal chandeliers, wood-paneled rooms, and wall-sized mirrors. Modern conveniences include complementary wireless high-speed Internet, a fitness center, and a business center.</p>

			<p>Most importantly, two of the hotel’s grand ballrooms feature traditional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprung_floor">spring-loaded hardwood dance floors</a>. Such floors provide subtle “give” via underlying layers of woven wooden battens that bend. As discerning dancers know, sprung floors feel softer, enhance performance, cause less fatigue, absorb shocks, and reduce injuries. They are considered the best type of floor for dancing and other indoor sports. Such floors are rare and difficult to find—especially originals laid nearly a century ago.</p>

			<p id="quote">“Dance and stomp as hard as you want... your muscles may get sore but your joints won’t. It’s very forgiving. You must experience this floor if you love to dance.”</p>

			<img class="pic" src="images/floor_pic.jpg" alt="Square dancers on wood floor" title="Dancing away the hours" width="406px" height="286px" align="right">

			<p>The hotel is located in the heart of <a href="http//www.yorkpa.org">Downtown York</a>, within easy walking distance of the historic Central Market and dozens of trendy restaurants and brewpubs. Briefly the capital of the young United States, York is close to Gettysburg, Lancaster, and many historic sites and charming towns.</p>
